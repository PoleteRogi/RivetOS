# RivetOS - Unified Operating System Platform
RivetOS is a platform that aims to unify all devices to function in a single operating system, providing a more integrated and straightforward user experience. RivetOS is presented as an interface that sits on top of existing operating systems, such as Android or Linux.

## Problems with Current Operating Systems
Currently, there are many different operating systems for various devices, which can be confusing and challenging for the average user to manage. Additionally, different operating systems often have different interfaces and applications, making the user experience even more difficult.

On the other hand, the lack of compatibility between devices is also a frequent problem. Many devices cannot communicate with each other, making it difficult to interact and limiting their functionality.

## RivetOS' Proposed Solution
RivetOS aims to solve these problems by providing a unified interface that allows users to manage all their devices from a single place. Rivet would be available for multiple devices, including computers, mobile phones, televisions, appliances, and more.

## How to Use RivetOS
RivetOS is currently in development and not yet available for use. However, we plan to release it soon and provide installation instructions and user guides.
